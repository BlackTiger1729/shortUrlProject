    <h1>Create a short link in a click.</h1>
    <p>URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made
        substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to
        the web page that has a long URL.</p>

    <p> For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to
        "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" can be shortened to
        "https://w.wiki/U". Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one.</p>

    <!-- <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"> -->
        <label>Paste the URL to be shortened</label>
        <input [(ngModel)]="extenderUrl" >
        <button (click)="onSubmit()">Submit</button>
    <!-- </form> -->

    <div *ngIf="resultUrl?.result_url"> <a href="{{resultUrl.result_url}}" target="_blank">{{resultUrl.result_url}}</a></div>
</div>
